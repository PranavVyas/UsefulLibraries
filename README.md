5. **Picasso**
Some of the pitfalls that Picasso takes care of include handling ImageView recycling and downloading cancelation in an adapter, facilitating complex image transformations using minimal memory, automatic memory, and caching.
Picasso automatically detects adapter re-use and the previously canceled download.

It easily and effectively transforms images to make them fit better into layouts and reduce memory size.

For more advanced effects, one can specify custom transformations.

8. Expenso

9. TimeRangePicker

- [x] The project is 100% written in Kotlin and was created to mimic Apple’s iOS or Samsung’s bedtime picker. It has good documentation, which also helps with the first configuration.

10. Retrofit
- [x] Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java developed and maintained by Square (the same company that supports Picasso). Retrofit is the most used networking library in Android development. In Retrofit, with just annotations, you can easily add a request body, manipulate endpoints, manipulate headers, add query parameters, and choose request methods. Retrofit also handles parsing to POJOs very well by using converters.

11. Dagger2
- [x] Dagger2 is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an upgrade to the earlier version (Dagger1) created by Square that is now maintained by Google. The recent Dagger version includes Android specific helpers for Android. Specifically, the auto-generation of subcomponents using a new code generator. Dagger2 is very deep and may require just more than the brief sample usage for adequate understanding, but let's take a look at it anyway.

12. Calligraphy
-[x] Calligraphy is one of the most popular custom font libraries available and it is quite easy to get along with. With this library, we can easily declare a single font across our whole application or define fonts individually to a text.
