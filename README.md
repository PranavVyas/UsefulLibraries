5. **Picasso**
Some of the pitfalls that Picasso takes care of include handling ImageView recycling and downloading cancelation in an adapter, facilitating complex image transformations using minimal memory, automatic memory, and caching.
Picasso automatically detects adapter re-use and the previously canceled download.

It easily and effectively transforms images to make them fit better into layouts and reduce memory size.

For more advanced effects, one can specify custom transformations.
